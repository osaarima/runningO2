You can find singularity from here
https://github.com/hpcng/singularity
and installation instructions from here
https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/blob/master/INSTALL.md
Using stable versions is recommended.

If you wish, you can compile the container yourself from the definition file.
Precise instructions for how to compile the container are included in the def
file itself.

As the ALICE software takes quite a lot of space, I recommend reserving 100 GB
of free storage space for temporary files before starting, and also 16 GB of
RAM. The def file is designed for 10 threads, but you can reduce the amount of
threads if you wish to do so. The end file should be around 21 GB in size.

If you have some special modifications for the installation you can simply
modify the installation commands in the .def file to your needs.
